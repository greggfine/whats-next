    <h1><strong>Gregg Fine - musician, educator, developer, creative collaborator</strong></h1>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve worn a lot of hats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎧 Music producer and composer for ads, films, records, and television shows</li>
      <li>🎸 Touring and session guitarist</li>
      <li>💻 Full-stack engineer and web developer</li>
      <li>🏫 Educator, mentor, and course creator</li>
      <li>🎮 Mixer and audio engineer</li>
      <li>🎶 Jazz musician</li>
      <li>🧠 Product-minded problem solver</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’ve always been someone who builds things — creative, technical, collaborative. <br /> Sometimes solo, sometimes as part of a team.</p>

    <p>But now, I’m looking for what’s next.</p>
    <p>
While freelance projects and startups will always be part of my toolkit, I'm looking to contribute to something meaningful — something structured, 
with new energy, new people, and creative purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>I’m especially interested in opportunities that involve:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Supporting creative direction — whether through production, content development, or education</li>
      <li>Using my blend of musical, creative, and strategic thinking to connect dots and move things forward</li>
      <li>Contributing to products at the intersection of music and technology</li>
      <li>Being part of something I believe in - with energy, momentum, and a strong creative pulse</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I’d bring to the table:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Extensive background in music production and advertising — with a track record of delivering at a professional level</li>
      <li>Fluency in both the creative and technical — able to bridge disciplines and make ideas make sense</li>
      <li>A creator’s mindset — with hands-on experience scripting, narrating, and producing educational and creative content</li>
      <li>The ability to take ideas from spark to finish line — thoughtfully and thoroughly</li>
      <li>Empathy and curiousity, with the ability to translate across roles, disciplines, and mindsets</li>
    </ul>

      <p>If that aligns with what you or your team might be looking for — now or sometime in the future — I’d love to connect. And if something or someone comes to mind — I’d be grateful for the recommendation or intro..</p>
